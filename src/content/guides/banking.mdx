## 1. Interac e-Transfer (Top Pick 🇨🇦)

Interac is the gold standard for Canadian casino players. It connects directly to your bank account (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, etc.) and offers bank-level security without sharing your card details.

### Why use Interac?

- **Safety:** You never share card numbers with the casino.
- **Speed:** Deposits are instant; withdrawals usually land within hours.
- **Cost:** Most casinos charge $0 fees for Interac.

## 2. Cryptocurrency (Fastest Payouts ⚡)

If speed is your priority, crypto is unbeatable. While bank transfers rely on business hours, the blockchain operates 24/7.

> **Pro Tip:** Casinos like **Bitstarz** process crypto withdrawals automatically, meaning you get your money in under 10 minutes.

### Popular Coins

1.  **Bitcoin (BTC):** High security, but slower network (10-30 mins).
2.  **Litecoin (LTC):** Low fees ($0.01) and fast confirmations (2 mins).
3.  **Tether (USDT):** Stablecoin tied to the US dollar, avoiding volatility.

## 3. Credit Cards (Visa / Mastercard)

While convenient, credit cards are becoming harder to use for gambling in Canada due to bank restrictions.

- **Pros:** Instant deposits, widely accepted.
- **Cons:** Many Canadian banks block gambling transactions. Withdrawals can take 3-5 business days.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the fastest withdrawal method?

Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin) are the fastest, often taking less than 15 minutes. Interac e-Transfer is the fastest fiat option, usually taking 1-3 hours.

### Do I have to pay taxes on casino winnings?

No. In Canada, gambling winnings are generally considered a windfall and are tax-free for recreational players.

### Can I deposit with PayPal?

PayPal is rarely accepted at Canadian online casinos. We recommend using **Interac** or **MuchBetter** instead.
