## Quick Verdict

FastPay Casino is a modern, fast-paced site best known for its **"Daily Slot Races"** and mission-based loyalty program. It runs on the same powerful engine as Bitstarz, meaning payouts are extremely fast compared to traditional sites.

## The "FastPay Missions" Unlike other casinos that just give you points, Woo Casino
sets you "Missions." Completing these unlocks instant cash prizes and free spins
with **3x wagering**, which is very low.

## Wagering Requirements

The standard welcome bonus has a 40x wagering requirement.

## Banking Speed Test

We tested a withdrawal using **Bitcoin**.

- **Request Time:** 4:00 PM
- **Received:** 4:28 PM
- **Total Wait:** ~28 Minutes

While slightly faster than Woo, it is still miles ahead of credit card casinos.
