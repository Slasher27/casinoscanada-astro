## Quick Verdict

Bitstarz is widely considered the "Gold Standard" for crypto casinos in Canada. While they lack telephone support, their **8-minute average withdrawal time** and massive game library (4,000+ slots) make them a top choice for serious players.

## Banking & Payout Speeds

This is where Bitstarz shines. We tested a withdrawal using **Litecoin (LTC)**.

They also accept Interac for fiat deposits, though withdrawals via bank transfer can take 1-3 business days.
