		<h1>About Casinos Canada 🍁</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to <strong>CasinosCanada.online</strong>. We are a team of
			data-driven gambling experts dedicated to providing honest, transparent
			reviews for Canadian players.
		</p>

		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>
			Most casino sites rely on guesswork. We rely on <strong>Data</strong>. We
			personally test every casino listed on this site with real money to
			verify:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Payout Speeds:</strong> We time exactly how long it takes to get our
				money back.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Bonus Terms:</strong> We read the fine print so you don't have to.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Licensing:</strong> We verify certificates with regulators like the
				MGA and Curacao.
			</li>
		</ul>
